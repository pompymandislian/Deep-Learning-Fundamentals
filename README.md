This is a repository for how to create fundamentals in deep learning. You can learn about deep learning from this and my YouTube channel, **KepoInData**. 
I'm recommending that before you enter the directory, you learn about Pythorch Fundamentals and Next Pytorch Fundamentals first. Have fun learning.
