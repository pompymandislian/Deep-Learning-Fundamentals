This is a repository for how to create fundamentals in deep learning. You can learn about deep learning from this and For a more in-depth explanation of the code, see on my YouTube channel, **KepoInData** . 
I'm recommending this for the learning journey:

1. Pythorch Fundamentals
2. Next Pytorch Fundamentals
3. Neural Network
4. RNN
5. GRU
6. LSTM


Follow step-by-step from the first
